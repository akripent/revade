# Revade C
Welcome to the Revade for C repository. This branch is intended to be an optional replacement for those who seek better speed than Node.JS to scale up or speed up their bot.
<br>
<b>Pros</b>
- Although this can vary at any time: platform/architecture universality.<br>
- Speed improvement over the original Node.JS<br>
- Adaptability, while not sacrificing speed: The C variant could be modified to, for example, if someone were to wish to do so, support LuaJIT+FFI. This would, of course, slow down things - but again, you could, and for example LuaJIT simplifies the syntax and overall resource management.<br>
- Scalability: C can be easily scaled, as opposed to Node.JS and its limiting factors due to its nature.<br>
- Resource management: You can have more performance, less memory usage & optimize CPU usage.
<br>
<b>Cons</b>
- Of course, harder to write for someone used to Node.JS<br>
- Probably not as much "install and go" support as Node.JS<br>
- Updates may naturally take more because it's not as straightforward
<br>
<br>
<b>What will happen to the original Node.JS variant?</b>
- The Node.JS variant has no discontinuation date & we don't plan to remove it.<br>
- The Node.JS variant will still have support, and probably the best at that<br>
- The Node.JS variant may slow down updates to stay as close as possible to the C variant's updates. We don't want big differences in terms of support.
