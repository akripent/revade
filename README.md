# Revade 10 Stable
Welcome to the Revade Stable repository. If you're an experienced at finding code issues, you can set the project up with your knowledge and if you have any suggestions you'd like us to consider to change our open-source code, go ahead! We appreciate feedback!

The documentation page is currently on work (It will guide on how to get it up and working on your machine. It won't be done anytime soon because school projects are murdering..)
