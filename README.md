# Revade Canary
Welcome to the Revade Canary repository. This branch is the testbed for Revade features, and may risk being unstable or not fully finished. This is for risktakers :)

If you're an experienced at finding code issues, you can set the project up with your knowledge (though ideally a matter of node main.js, provided you have all the npm packages the code requires installed) and if you have any suggestions you'd like us to consider, to add or modify existing functionality in the open source code, go ahead! Create an issue! We appreciate feedback!
