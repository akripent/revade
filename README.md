# Revade Canary
Welcome to the Revade Canary repository. You are seeing the testbed for Revade Stable. Some things are expected to fail.
<br>
If you're an experienced at finding code issues, you can set the project up with your knowledge (though ideally a matter of node main.js, provided you have all the npm packages the code requires installed) and if you have any suggestions you'd like us to consider, to add or modify existing functionality in the open source code, go ahead! We appreciate feedback!

There is a documentation page (WIP) available at https://akripent.github.io/docs/
